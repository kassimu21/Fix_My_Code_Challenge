I finished and deployed my Rails blog but people are contacting me because they can’t access any of my blog posts… Weird, it works for me…

Could you take a look and fix it? My code base is here.

Also, when you’re done, could you add a new feature please?

I would like to add a boolean online for each Post object with a default value true. With this boolean, I will be able to hide/show some blog posts from the listing. I will also need a way to change this boolean in the Post#edit route. Could you do this for me?

Thank you!
